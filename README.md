The goal of the project is to learn how windows, sprites, textures, and events work, and to work with game logic</br>

In the project we use the school graphical library: MiniLibX </br> 
This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events. <br>
